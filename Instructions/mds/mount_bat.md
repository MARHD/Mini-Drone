1. Place a thin layer of clear tape onto the surface of the battery to prevent the clear glue from bonding to the batteries plastic.

Place clear glue on the areas shown in the carriage of the frame.

3. Slide the battery in, with the power cable nearest to the XT30 connector of the power module.

Hold the battery in place, trying to keep it centered in the carriage long ways and to the side of the SPI connector sticking out of the Pixracer.
