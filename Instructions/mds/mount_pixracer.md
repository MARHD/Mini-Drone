1. Find the arrow indicating foreward on the Pixracer.

2. Rotate the Pixracer 180 degrees, keeping the arrow facing forewards and fit the Pixracer into the frame as seen in the image, with the foreward arrow aligned with the arrow on the frame. 
It might need to be put in at an angle, but should clip into the frame when correctly located.

4. Place at least two M2 screws into the mounting holes, with the nuts on the otherside and tighten with a screw driver, while holding the nut steady with either a socket or pliers.
