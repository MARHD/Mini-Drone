# Software

The compiled .apj file for the project can be found [here](/ArduCopter-4.1%20Custom/Builds/). 
It enables SPI on the port originally designed for the ESP-01 module, and is setup for a pixart 
optical flow sensor (PMW3901)

The ArduCopter parameters used, can be found [here](/ArduCopter-4.%20Custom/Mission%20planner%20Parameters/).
You will still need to calibrate your sensors and some options may need you to follow the ArduCopter guides (such as tuning).

The files which were modified in the firmware can be found [here](/ArduCopter-4.1%20Custom/Modified%20files/).
The unmodified file is also available for comparison.

Finally the Source code for the build of ArduCopter used is available [here](/ArduCopter-4.1%20Custom/Source/)
