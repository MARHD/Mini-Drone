Build Instructions
==
## Required tools
* Access to a 3D printer capable of printing PLA or ABS
* 2mm flathead screwdriver (or whichever is needed for the M2 screws you bought)
* M2 socket or wrench (or even a pair of pliers)
* 1.5mm Torx screwdriver (for 1103 motors included screws)
* Wire Cutters
* Wire Strippers
* Soldering Iron
* Solder (preferably leaded with flux)

## Notes on assembly
* Note1: Loctite should be used on screws only once confident everything is correctly assembled. Or locknuts could be used instead. 

* Note2: Once all parts have been gathered and printed, the drone can be assembled within around 3-4 hours. This excludes flight testing and debugging, so first time assembly will take longer.
