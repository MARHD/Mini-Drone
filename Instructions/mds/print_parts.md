# Printing & assembling plastic parts

1. Print the two .stl files, [here](/./Mechanical%20Design/STL%20Files/Frame_top.stl) for the top frame and [here](/./Mechanical%20Design/STL%20Files/Frame_carriage.stl) for the carriage. Optionally the Stand [here](/./Mechanical%20Design/STL%20Files/Stand.stl) can also be printed. <img src="/./Images/Instructions/3.jpeg" height="300">

1. Rotate the top frame such that the foreward arrow is facing foreward, and the posts are facing downwards. <img src="/./Images/Instructions/1.jpeg" height="300">
1. Rotate the carriage such that the foreward arrow is also facing foreward, and the posts are facin upwards. <img src="/./Images/Instructions/2.jpg" height="300">
