# Mini-Drone
Design of a Mini Drone for EEE4022S


Original project description:
Ardupilot is a professional grade open-source autopilot software stack. This
project requires a student to design a mini-drone (<250g) running the Ardupilot
firmware. An example of analogous drones are linked below. In addition to
designing and building this drone the student must integrate an openflow sensor,
used to facilitate drones holding position by using input from a downwards facing
camera.

Original Deliverables:
1. A literature review briefly summarising drone autopilot software, currently
available mini-drones, recent work using openflow sensors for localisation
2. A functioning mini-drone
3. All design files for (2) including mechanical, electrical, and software build
instructions in a documented public git repository
4. A qualification of the performance of the resulting design
5. The final thesis report, poster, and presentation

Budget:
