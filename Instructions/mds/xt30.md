# Replacing XT60 and battery connector with XT30

Skip to mounting the power brick should you wish to use XT60 connectors instead (battery connector replacement can follow the guide below)

1. Remove the plastic heat shrink from the power brick.

Note the positive and negative symbols on the connector, as well as which side of the Power brick has a male connector vs female.

2. Place the Power brick into helping hands such that the connector you are removing first is aimed directly down. Then turn on your soldering iron and tin the tip with solder.

Heat the large pads of the Power brick XT60 connector and apply leaded solder with flux (The large ground planes might need a strong soldering iron to melt)

3. Once the solder has started to melt on the connector, switch back and forth between heating the two pads, so that they both are being heated simultaneously.

Alternatively using two soldering irons on each of the pads would be easier. 

Keep doing this ensuring you dont hit any other components on the brick. The connector should fall off with gravity, but if not some tweezers can be used for persuasion. However do not pull on the connector if the solder is not melted, or you might rip pads. 

Proceed with the other connector as well...

6. Once both XT60's have been removed. Solder some thicker 14 AWG wire to all 4 of the pads, using colours to distinguish the positive and negative pads.

7. Now cut the wires on the side of the brick which had a female XT60, to be a fairly short 1.8-2 cm and solder a female XT30 onto the ends after removing insulation (dont forget the heat shrink)

8. Cut the remaining wires to be approximately 12 cm. Either solder the other wires directly to the ESC (as I have) or use another XT30 connector if you wish.

9. !Please be careful on this step! 

Cut the wires on the battery one at a time, fitting the heat shrink and soldering to the male XT30 connector.

I.e. Cut one wire, fit heat shrink, solder to XT30 and melt heat shrink on, then continue to the next wire.

NB: If you cut both wires at the same time, the battery will short and spark, worst case it could explode or cause a fire.
