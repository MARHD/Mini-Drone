# Wiring and Mounting the Flowdeck V2

1. Find your propellers and place them all with the writing facing upwards so that it is legible.

1. Locate 2 propellers which have "T65R" written on them and 2 which have "T65". 
Or if there is no direction indication, find 2 of each type of prop, with the writing facing upwards or the moulding marks facing downwards, the propeller types should look opposite to each other.
Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc1QG_Njo7Y&t=238s&ab_channel=JoshuaBardwell) to learn how to tell which propeller is for CW or CCW.

1. Hold the motors still and fit the propellers onto the motor shafts according to the following diagram.
Twisting the propellers will help to get them on. 
NB: Do not push the propellers so far that the shaft is visible above the hole of the propeller.

1. Rotate the propellers on the motor shaft such that the holes line up with the holes in the motor.
Then use the provided motor screws (longer ones) to slowly screw the propeller in place until the motor shaft is just barely flush with the top of the propeller.
